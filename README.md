Training materials for the methylation course (bisulfite-sequencing) in the **[International School on Big Data and Epigenomics applied to Public Health](https://campusvirtual.fiocruz.br/gestordecursos/hotsite/BigDataEpigenomics)**


### Credits

All the materials are obtained from the following resources:

- Babraham Institute's [Analysing bisulfite methylation sequencing data course](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/training.html#bsseq)
- Biconductor edgeR package section 4.7 [Bisulfite sequencing of mouse oocytes](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf)


### Introduction

Provide a look at the computational steps needed for the analysis of bisulfite sequencing data.
Lectures and practicals covering the fundamentals of DNA methylation in genomes, processing of raw sequence data and  QC, visualisation, quantification and differential methylation analysis.
